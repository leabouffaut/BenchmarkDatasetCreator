How to install on a Mac

1) Open terminal at the folder level you want to work (right clic > New Terminal at Folder)
2) Follow instructions of https://mnzel.medium.com/how-to-activate-python-venv-on-a-mac-a8fa1c3cb511 to create a virtual environment. 

On my Mac, I need to use: 
	> pip3.9 install --user virtualenv
	> 

3) Activate the virtual environment
	> source venv/bin/activate
Now you should see (venv) on the left of your terminal (don't close it).

4) Download the BenchmarkDatasetCreator from the Github Repository and place it in your work folder
https://github.com/leabouffaut/BenchmarkDatasetCreator/

5) back in the (venv) environment you'll need to install some packages entering the following (check if the folderName for the Benchmark Dataset Creator matches yours)
	> python3.9 -m pip install -r BenchmarkDatasetCreator-main/requirements.txt

6) Now you're all set! Start the application using:
	> streamlit run BenchmarkDatasetCreator-main/BenchmarkDatasetCreator_app/Home.py

To stop the app, close the terminal or ctrl+c



After the first installation, to reopen the app:
1) Activate the virtual environment at the working folder
	> source venv/bin/activate
2) Launch the App:
	> streamlit run BenchmarkDatasetCreator-main/BenchmarkDatasetCreator_app/Home.py
