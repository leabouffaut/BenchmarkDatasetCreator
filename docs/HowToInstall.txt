1) Open terminal at the folder level you want to work (right clic > New Terminal at Folder)
2) Follow instructions of https://mnzel.medium.com/how-to-activate-python-venv-on-a-mac-a8fa1c3cb511 to create a virtual environment. If you already have python3.9 installed, skip to "Create your virtual environment" which are just the following two lines:
	> python3.9 -m venv venv
	> source venv/bin/activate

On my Mac, I need to use: 
	> pip3.9 install --user virtualenv
	> python3.9 -m venv venv
	> source venv/bin/activate


Now you should see (venv) on the left of your terminal (don't close it).

3) Download the BenchmarkDatasetCreator from the Github Repository and place it in your work folder
https://github.com/leabouffaut/BenchmarkDatasetCreator/

4) back in the (venv) environment you'll need to install some packages entering the following (check if the folderName for the Benchmark Dataset Creator matches yours)
	> python3.9 -m pip install -r BenchmarkDatasetCreator-main/requirements.txt

5) Now you're all set! Start the application using:
	> streamlit run BenchmarkDatasetCreator-main/BenchmarkDatasetCreator_app/Home.py
